## Building from source

We keep the following instructions for recent, commonly used operating system
versions. Most build failures are due to minor operating system differences in
dependencies and project setup. Refer to the
[Environment Setup Guide](docs/environment_setup_guide.md) for contributed
instructions and configurations for alternatives.

> [!TIP]
> While building from source offers the greatest flexibility,
> [installing from releases](#installing-from-releases) in supported
> configurations is often faster and easier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Frequent setup and building problems and their solutions can be found in section [Common Issues](docs/environment_setup_guide.md#common-issues).

### Setup - Ubuntu (24.04)

> [!TIP]
> `dvc` is used for version control of pre-compiled MIOpen kernels.
> `dvc` is not a hard requirement, but it does reduce compile time.
> `snap install --classic dvc` can be used to install on Ubuntu.
> Visit the [DVC website](https://dvc.org/doc/install/linux) for other installation methods.

```bash
# Install Ubuntu dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gfortran git ninja-build cmake g++ pkg-config xxd automake libtool python3-venv python3-dev libegl1-mesa-dev texinfo bison flex

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock.git
cd TheRock

# Install a patched patchelf from source. For details see
# https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/blob/main/docs/environment_setup_guide.md#patchelf
sudo apt install curl make
sudo env INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ./dockerfiles/install_pinned_patchelf.sh

# Init python virtual environment and install python dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download submodules and apply patches
python3 ./build_tools/fetch_sources.py
```

### Setup - Windows 11 (VS 2022)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See [windows_support.md](./docs/development/windows_support.md) for setup
> instructions on Windows, in particular
> the section for
> [installing tools](./docs/development/windows_support.md#install-tools).

If the build system is a non-English system. Make sure to switch to `utf-8`.

```cmd
chcp 65001
```

```bash
# Install dependencies following the Windows support guide

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock.git
cd TheRock

# Init python virtual environment and install python dependencies
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.bat
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download submodules and apply patches
# Note that dvc is used for pulling large files
python ./build_tools/fetch_sources.py
```

### Build configuration

The build can be customized through cmake feature flags.

#### Required configuration flags

- `-DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=`

  or

- `-DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_TARGETS=`

> [!NOTE]
> Not all family and targets are currently supported.
> See [therock_amdgpu_targets.cmake](cmake/therock_amdgpu_targets.cmake) file
> for available options.

#### Discovering available targets on your system

In case you don't have an existing ROCm/HIP installation from which you can run any of these tools:

| Tool                    | Platform |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| `amd-smi`               | Linux    |
| `rocm-smi`              | Linux    |
| `rocm_agent_enumerator` | Linux    |
| `hipinfo`               | Windows  |
| `offload-arch`          | Both     |

You can install the `rocm` Python package for any architecture inside a venv and run `offload-arch` from there:

1. `python build_tools/setup_venv.py --index-name nightly --index-subdir gfx110X-all --packages rocm .tmpvenv`
1. `.tmpvenv/bin/offload-arch` on Linux, `.tmpvenv\Scripts\offload-arch` on Windows
1. `rm -rf .tmpvenv`

#### Optional configuration flags

By default, the project builds everything available. The following group flags
enable/disable selected subsets:

| Group flag                         | Description                          |

| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_EMULATION=ON`    | Enables emulation tools              |

Individual features can be controlled separately (typically in combination with
`-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_ALL=OFF` or `-DTHEROCK_RESET_FEATURES=ON` to force a
minimal build):

| Component flag                         | Description                                         |

By default, components are built from the sources fetched via the submodules.
For some components, external sources can be used by setting the following couple
options:

| External source settings                         | Description                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-DTHEROCK_USE_EXTERNAL_<COMPONENT STRING>=OFF`  | Enable/Disable external source location for a component |
| `-DTHEROCK_<COMPONENT_STRING>_SOURCE_DIR=<PATH>` | External path to the component sources                  |

The following components accept specifying alternative source locations:

| Component string    |
| ------------------- |
| `COMPOSABLE_KERNEL` |
| `ROCGDB`            |

Further flags allow to build components with specific features enabled.

| Other flags                                       | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-DTHEROCK_ENABLE_MPI=OFF`                        | Enables building components with Message Passing Interface (MPI) support |
| `-DTHEROCK_COMPOSABLE_KERNEL_FOR_MIOPEN_ONLY=OFF` | Builds composable_kernel with only the targets required for MIOpen       |

> [!NOTE]
> Building components with MPI support, currently requires MPI to be
> pre-installed until [issue #1284](https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/1284)
> is resolved.

### CMake build usage

For workflows that demand frequent rebuilds, it is _recommended to build it with ccache_ enabled to speed up the build.
See instructions in the next section for [Linux](#ccache-usage-on-linux) and [Windows](#ccache-usage-on-windows).

Otherwise, ROCm/HIP can be configured and build with just the following commands:

```bash
cmake -B build -GNinja . -DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=gfx110X-all
cmake --build build
```

#### CCache usage on Linux

To build with the [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) compiler cache:

- You must have a recent ccache (>= 4.11 at the time of writing) that supports
  proper caching with the `--offload-compress` option used for compressing
  AMDGPU device code.
- `export CCACHE_SLOPPINESS=include_file_ctime` to support hard-linking
- Proper setup of the `compiler_check` directive to do safe caching in the
  presence of compiler bootstrapping
- Set the C/CXX compiler launcher options to cmake appropriately.

Since these options are very fiddly and prone to change over time, we recommend
using the `./build_tools/setup_ccache.py` script to create a `.ccache` directory
in the repository root with hard coded configuration suitable for the project.

Example:

```bash
# Any shell used to build must eval setup_ccache.py to set environment
# variables.
eval "$(./build_tools/setup_ccache.py)"
cmake -B build -GNinja -DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=gfx110X-all \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache \
  .

cmake --build build
```

#### CCache usage on Windows

- You must have a recent ccache (>= 4.13.3 at the time of writing) that contains
  bug fixes for MSVC and supports proper caching with the `--offload-compress`
  option used for compressing AMDGPU device code.
- `export CCACHE_SLOPPINESS=include_file_ctime,pch_defines,time_macros` to
  support hard-linking and precompiled headers (amd-llvm is built with PCH).
- Proper setup of the `compiler_check` directive to do safe caching in the
  presence of compiler bootstrapping.
- Set the C/CXX compiler launcher options to cmake appropriately.

Since these options are very fiddly and prone to change over time, we recommend
using the `./build_tools/setup_ccache.py` script to create a `.ccache` directory
in the repository root with hard coded configuration suitable for the project.

Example (In Command Prompt):

```bat
# Any command prompt used to build must eval setup_ccache.py to set environment
# variables.
for /f "delims=" %i in ('python build_tools/setup_ccache.py') do @%i

cmake -B build -GNinja -DTHEROCK_AMDGPU_FAMILIES=gfx110X-all \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache ^
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache ^
  .

cmake --build build
```

### Running tests

Project-wide testing can be controlled with the standard CMake `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON|OFF` flag. This gates both setup of build tests and compilation of installed testing artifacts.

Tests of the integrity of the build are enabled by default and can be run
with ctest:

```
ctest --test-dir build
```

Testing functionality on an actual GPU is in progress and will be documented
separately.
